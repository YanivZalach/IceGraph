A chronological list of every snapshot in your selected range. Each row shows when the snapshot was created, what operation produced it, and how many files and records changed.

### Operation types

- **append** - new data was added to the table

- **overwrite** - new data was written, and any existing data in the affected partitions was replaced

- **replace** - files were rewritten without changing the actual records (compaction, rewriting manifests, etc)

- **delete** - rows or files were removed from the table

Use the Timeline to pinpoint when a large write happened, spot unexpected deletes, or verify that a compaction job ran as expected.

A red **Unknown Events** marker appears when metadata or snapshot data could not be read. Snapshots that simply fall outside the selected range are not flagged. It indicates that one or more events occurred in that part of the timeline, even when the exact events cannot be determined. The next readable event is compared with the previous readable metadata. Its details show the metadata changes, and when the snapshot changed they also show that snapshot's operation.

### Zoom & pan

Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out (text and nodes scale together, like Graph view). Drag the timeline background to pan. Use horizontal trackpad scroll or Shift + wheel to pan sideways without zooming. **Fit Timeline** scales the full history to the viewport and centers it.

### Details panel

Click a timeline event to open its details in a panel on the right - the same panel used in Graph view. Drag the left-edge grip to widen it, use fullscreen to expand, and copy field values with the clipboard icon. Long JSON diffs are collapsed by default and can be expanded or collapsed with **▼** / **▲**.

When the event's snapshot points at the job that wrote it, an **`action_link`** row links out to it, opening in a new tab.
